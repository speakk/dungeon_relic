-- ROT.JS -- License

-- While not verbatim, MUCH (most (the vast majority)) of the code involved in this project is derived from rot.js
-- rot.js is a wonderful javascript-based imagining of the libtcod library that many popular
-- roguelike developers use to make their lives easier
-- Keeping in mind the aforementioned derivation, I feel it necessary to include the rot.js license.

-- Damn near all of this would be laughably disfunctional if not for 30log.
-- 30log is a OOP solution for lua, created by Roland Yonaba. It's excellent for this sort of thing.
