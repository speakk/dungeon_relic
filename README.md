## A minimalistic example of a LÃ¶ve "game" with character movement and drawing sprites using the Concord ECS among other good community libraries.

The idea of this repo is to serve as a minimal but functional example on how to set up a game template using common patterns such as:

- Using an Entity Component System (ECS) for separating logic from data, with each part of the game handled in their corresponding systems
- Game state management (currently just switches to "ingame")
- Separate of concerns (thanks to the ECS)

Also features a media manager that loads your media into an atlas manager that you can query with hierarchical accessors like 'decals.bushes.purpleBush' based on the directory hierarchy.
